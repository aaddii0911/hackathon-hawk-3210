## Conclusion
- The analysis of vegetable price data in Noida and nearby markets uncovered significant variations in prices for both seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables. 
- These fluctuations appear to be associated with factors such as transportation costs, fluctuations in supply and demand, and government regulations.
- It is noteworthy that the impact of these price fluctuations was more pronounced for low-income households, evidenced by an average inflation rate of 5% observed throughout the study period.

In summary, this examination highlights the complex and nuanced nature of vegetable pricing dynamics, underscoring the crucial need for customized policies aimed at relieving the economic burden on vulnerable households.
